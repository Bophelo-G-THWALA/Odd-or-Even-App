HELLO! WELCOME TO THE ODD OR EVEN APP

Basically, all this does, it helps you determine whether the number you (user) entered is odd or even.

As you know, in mathematics to determine whether a number is odd or even, it is determined by this formula

Number entered:

if even: Number % 2 == 0
 OR
if odd: Number % 2 == 1 (remainder)

E.g

Number entered: 10

10 % 2 = 0 (It is even)

Or

Number entered: 5

5 % 2 = 1 (equals to 2 remainder 1)

if you don't enter a number or enter a letter , the message displays "Please enter a valid number."


THANK YOU! AND ENJOY THE APP!
